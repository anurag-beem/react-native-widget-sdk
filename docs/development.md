Besides a React Native application, the only dependency to develop this application is
Node v16. Once Node is installed, you can install all other dependencies with
npm. Below are commands you will find useful while developing this application:

```
npm install             # Install depedencies
npm run build           # Run TypeScript compiler
npm run build:dist      # Compile and save output to dist directory
npm run test            # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage   # Run unit tests and generate code coverage report
npm run open:coverage   # Open code coverage report
npm run generate        # Run code generators
```
