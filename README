# Setup

First, you will need to set up your environment so that you can run React
Native apps. See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup for
instructions on how to do that. In addition, you'll need to download and
install Android Studio and Xcode.

Once your environment is setup, create a config.json file that looks like the
one below, but with the appropriate values (all of which you can get from
Batcave):


    {
      "MX_CLIENT_ID": "...",
      "MX_API_KEY": "...",
      "MX_USER_GUID": "...",
      "MX_ENVIRONMENT": "integration"
    }


Now you're ready to run the app. Install all dependencies and link any native
libraried, and then either in an iOS or Android emulator:

    npm install
    npm link
    npm run ios
    npm run android
