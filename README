# Setup

First, you will need to set up your environment so that you can run React
Native apps. See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup for
instructions on how to do that. In addition, you'll need to download and
install Android Studio, Xcode, and Node v17.

Once your environment is setup, create a config.json file that looks like the
one below, but with the appropriate values (all of which you can get from
Batcave):

    {
      "MX_CLIENT_ID": "...",
      "MX_API_KEY": "...",
      "MX_USER_GUID": "...",
      "MX_ENVIRONMENT": "integration"
    }


Next, install dependencies, link native libraries, and then install and run the
app in an iOS or Android emulator. Here are all of the commands you need to do
that:

    npm install             # Installs dependencies
    npm link                # Links native libraries in iOS and Android apps
    npm run ios             # Installs and runs app in iOS emulator
    npm run android         # Installs and runs app in Android emulator


Other useful commands for developers:

    npm run build           # Run TypeScript compiler
    npm run dist            # Compile and save output to dist directory
    npm run test            # Run unit tests
    npm run test:coverage   # Run unit tests and generate code coverage report
    npm run open:coverage   # Open code coverage report
    npm run generate        # Run code generators
